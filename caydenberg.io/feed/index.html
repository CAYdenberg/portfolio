While these are often conflated, we need to recognize that sometimes there is a balance between the two of them.</p>

While state might seem like an implementation detail, with experience it becomes more a part of the design process, allowing us to accurately predict &quot;sad path&quot; situations that may arise when the app is in a particular state.</p>

React is not a framework and so it doesn&#39;t enforce a particular way of grouping related code or related files, code style or organization. I&#39;ve been thinking about what it means to provide forward-maintainability in this type of codebase and how we can make our code understandable to other human beings.</p>
